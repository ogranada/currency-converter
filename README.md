# Currency Converter

This is a basic currency converter.

## General information

* It use the [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/) API.
* To get flags we are using the [countryflags.io](https://www.countryflags.io/) API.
* The CSS structure is based on [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) architecture and [Bliss](https://github.com/gilbox/css-bliss) naming convention.

## Improvement Areas

* Add unit testing for the project.
* Improve accessibility using keyboard with many cards.
* Review user experience and add labels if is necesary.

## Considerations:

* The product is available for edge 15 and newer.
  - Use of templates.
  - Use of date input.
* The ApiManager class was created using prototypes just to show how to use prototypes to simulate OOP.
